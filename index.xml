      <description>If I wrote a book, it would be called APFMAT. And I&amp;rsquo;d sell it for a penny.
I wonder what I would write in it maybe I will write about me wondering what it must be like in other people&amp;rsquo;s heads I was watching Legion the other day and wished I was a telepath like the main character what an awesome show that is turning out to be I hope they don&amp;rsquo;t screw it up like they did Heroes so far it looks very promising I especially like the sound design and the camerawork like in that scene where they reveal that things are not really what they seem to be and he is actually being interrogated by not-a-cop I kept trying to remember where I had seen that actor before and realized he had played the disgraced journalist in The Newsroom man Aaron Sorkin has an amazing writing staff that reminds me I have to watch The West Wing it is supposed to be the best tv show about politics ever speaking of which why is Rahul Gandhi such an easy target he really needs to hire a better branding and PR team &amp;ndash;</description>

      <description>The Intention Of late, I have been thinking about life and death and life beyond death.
I now believe that creating everlasting art is the only way to achieve true immortality. Art (and progeny, to a certain extent) is the only way to live beyond the grave.
And since I am not yet anywhere close to creating the kind of art that would qualify even for consideration in the &amp;ldquo;everlasting&amp;rdquo; category, I decided to be more intentional about whatever I do create.</description>
