      <description>Brooklyn Nine Nine S05 E14 has got to be one of the best TV Comedy episodes ever.
It’s about triumph of Good over Evil. It’s about honest cops getting the bad guy using legal means.
It’s about a lovely pseudo-parent-child relationship. It’s about a person who wants the approval of their parent-figure.
It’s funny. It constantly keeps you sniggering at a pace that is the right sniggering pace. And it has an inside joke that the characters laugh at, unlike most other jokes in this series, maybe even all comedy shows, which are at some character’s expense.</description>

      <description>I am going to assume that you have already seen this movie, and are open to discussing what would otherwise be spoilers. Turn around NOW if you have not seen this movie yet!
Also, I have not yet read the books or watched the other movies, so some of my thoughts below might be divergent from what was uncovered in those later works.
What a great weekend! It all started with a session on focus to fix the issues with my blog deployment - something had broken when I had deployed Hugo the last time and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to fix it.</description>
