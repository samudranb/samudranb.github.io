      <description>Brooklyn Nine Nine S05 E14 has got to be one of the best TV Comedy episodes ever.
It’s about triumph of Good over Evil. It’s about honest cops getting the bad guy using legal means.
It’s about a lovely pseudo-parent-child relationship. It’s about a person who wants the approval of their parent-figure.
It’s funny. It constantly keeps you sniggering at a pace that is the right sniggering pace. And it has an inside joke that the characters laugh at, unlike most other jokes in this series, maybe even all comedy shows, which are at some character’s expense.</description>
