      <description>The Intention Of late, I have been thinking about life and death and life beyond death.
I now believe that creating everlasting art is the only way to achieve true immortality. Art (and progeny, to a certain extent) is the only way to live beyond the grave.
And since I am not yet anywhere close to creating the kind of art that would qualify even for consideration in the &amp;ldquo;everlasting&amp;rdquo; category, I decided to be more intentional about whatever I do create.</description>
